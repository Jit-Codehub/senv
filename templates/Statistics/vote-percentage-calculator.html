            <h3>Solved Example on How to Calculate Percentage of a Vote</h3>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>Find the percentage of the votes of all parties? If the number of votes polled in the election for the Democratic Party is 3,08,596, for Republican Party is 1,09,887 and for other parties is 4,00,968.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Given that,</p>
            <p>Numbers of votes polled for Democratic Party = 3,08,596</p>
            <p>No of votes polled for Republican Party = 1,09,887</p>
            <p>Numbers of votes polled for Other parties = 4,00,968</p>
            <p>Now, find the total polled votes by summing up all the votes polled by each party</p>
            <p>ie., 3,08,596 + 1,09,887 + 4,00,968</p>
            <p>= 819451</p>
            <p>Votes Percentage for Democratic Party = (Numbers of votes polled for Democratic Party / Total number of votes polled) x 100</p>
            <p>= (3,08,596 / 819451) x 100</p>
            <p>= 0.3765 x 100</p>
            <p>= 37.65%</p>
            <p>Votes Percentage for Republican Party = (Numbers of votes polled for Republican Party / Total number of votes polled) x 100</p>
            <p>= (1,09,887 / 819451) x 100</p>
            <p>= 0.1340 x 100</p>
            <p>= 13.40%</p>
            <p>Votes Percentage for Other parties = (Numbers of votes polled for Other parties / Total number of votes polled) x 100</p>
            <p>= (4,00,968 / 819451) x 100</p>
            <p>= 0.4893 x 100</p>
            <p>= 48.93%</p>
            <p>Hence, the Votes Percentage for Democratic Party is 37.65%, the Votes Percentage for Republican Party is 13.40%, Votes Percentage for the Other parties is 48.93%.</p>
